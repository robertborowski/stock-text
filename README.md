Purpose: Save look up time for latest stock news.

Problem: My day job keeps me busy and I rarely have time to look at the latest news on the stocks I own/have on my watchlist in the market.
I often find out major company news early the following day, days after the event occurs, or never at all.
Examples of news I have missed: A new person was added to the company board and the stock price went up +5%. The company had a major recall and stock went down -7%. The CEO was involved in a scandal, stock down -8%.

This program will:
1. Keep a list of stock symbols that a user wants to track.
2. Look up the live % change (positive or negative) from the previous close date. There will have to be a minimum % change to trigger even bothering to look up a news article (example: a big company has a minimum 7%+- change, pretty much guarantees that an article will be written about it by the end of the day)
3. Send the user a bare minimum text message about the news. Text will include [the symbol, the % change from previous close, a link to the article news headline (pulled from Google News)]

Example Text:
"TSLA -7% from previous close
<link_to_google_news_article>Tesla has recall on 150k cars</link_to_google_news_article>"

That's it. A simple text message that keeps the user informed on major changes to the company stocks they follow.
